# RPG Tactical Fantasy Game

<b>WARNING</b> : This game is entirely under construction.

The game is an RPG Tactical Fantasy game, turn-based and is in 2D.
I'm currently looking for a good name (temporary : " In the name of the Five Cats ").

## How to help development

## How to start the game

Type the following command in a shell at the project root :
