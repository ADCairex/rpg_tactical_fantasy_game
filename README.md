# RPG Tactical Fantasy Game

<b>WARNING</b> : This game is entirely under construction.

The game is an RPG Tactical Fantasy game, turn-based and is in 2D.
I'm currently looking for a good name (temporary : " In the name of the Five Cats ").

## How to help development

You can submit any request you want, or notify me about any bug you encountered, by sending an e-mail to grimmys.programming@gmail.com or by opening an issue.
